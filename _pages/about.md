I am a third-year undergraduate at Fudan University, pursuing a degree in Statistics. My research focuses on the intersection of statistics and artificial intelligence, with two long-term goals. The first is **developing novel methodologies for scientific discovery by integrating statistical theory with machine learning**, like conformal prediction and prediction powered inference. The second is **designing next-generation neural network systems capable of self-evolution and adaptation**, contributing to the pursuit of **real** intelligence. I am fortunate to conduct my research in close collaboration with Prof. [Jiaye Teng](https://www.tengjiaye.com/), [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/) and [Jingzhao Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/jingzhao/home).

Recently, my academic interests have gravitated towards **formal language reasoning**, a domain I believe is pivotal for the future of artificial intelligence. Its significance, in my view, can be understood from two primary perspectives. The first is **AI safety**. In contrast to the inherent ambiguities of natural language, formal languages are precise. This precision is instrumental for verifying that an agent's behavior aligns with human intent, thereby mitigating unforeseen risks. The second perspective is **Verifiability**, which I see as a cornerstone for enabling true intelligence. Formal languages could automatedly verify an agent's outputs. This is instrumental in establishing a reward mechanism that is both verifiable and independent of direct human annotation (**I agree with Sutton that reward is enough, but that doesn't mean I think the current reinforcement learning paradigm is good enough**). Such a training paradigm, which transcends the limitations of human-in-the-loop supervision, is, in my view, a prerequisite for achieving self-evolution. Consequently, I contend that formal language reasoning is a critical research direction for developing AI systems that are simultaneously capable of autonomous self-improvement and are provably safe.

I am currently seeking for a research assistant position in Summer 2026. Please feel free to send me an email if you are interested in my research and background.
