I am an undergraduate majoring in Statistics at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, with a keen interest in machine learning theory. My research focus is on providing mathematical explanations for intriguing phenomena in deep learning. While modern machine learning systems are highly complex and often rely on intuition and experimental approaches, I believe that rigorous theoretical analysis can offer valuable insights and have the potential to guide the design and optimization of neural networks, driving the advancement of high-performance artificial intelligence.
