## Financial Experience

Before dive into the research, I tried to find a job in the financial industry. I have three internships in finance:
- Galois Private Equity Fund Management Co., Ltd. as a quantitative researcher intern.
- Sinolink Securities Co., Ltd. as an internship in investment banking department.
- Boston Consulting Group as a part-time assistant.

I learned a lot from my internship.
