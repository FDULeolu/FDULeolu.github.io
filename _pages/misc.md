## Financial Experience

Before dive into the research, I tried to find a job in the financial industry. I have three internships in finance:
- Galois Private Equity Fund Management Co., Ltd. as a quantitative researcher intern.
- Sinolink Securities Co., Ltd. as an internship in investment banking department.
- Boston Consulting Group as a part-time assistant.

I learned a lot from my internship.

## Danta Tech

Recently I joined the [Danta Tech](https://danxi.fduhole.com/) as a member of AI Studio, which aims to introduce AI algorithms into our App "DanXi". "DanXi" is a school assistant providing Fudan entrance QR code, classroom schedule, library popularity and so on. "DanXi" also has a TreeHole, which is a anonymous forum and is the most popular function of our app. I hope my work could help other students.
